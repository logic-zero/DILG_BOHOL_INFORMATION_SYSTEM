                        The promulgation of Republic Act 6975, otherwise known as the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Act of 1990, operationalized and initiated the call for a tangible reform in the countryâ€™s public safety services particularly for the uniformed bureaus under DILG.
                        The same Act factually complied with the constitutional mandate for a unified single national police force, which is civilian in character under the administration of the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM). Likewise, the same law upgraded the fire and jail services as new and separate bureaus under the DILG stewardship.

Specifically, the Fire Bureau s charter was created under Chapter IV (Section 53 to 59) and carried-out through the provisions of Rule VII (Sections 49 to 58) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the said law.

                        As one of the five pillars of the Criminal Justice System, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) was created to address growing concern of jail management and penology problem. Primarily, its clients are detainees accused before a court who are temporarily confined in such jails while undergoing investigation, waiting final judgement and those who are serving sentence promulgated by the court 3 years and below. As provided for under R.A. No. 6975, the Jail Bureau is mandated to take operational and administrative control over all city, district and municipal jails.

                        The Philippine National Police (PNP) has put in place all necessary safeguards to eliminate every possible situation or opportunity for corruption in the police service.
                        We acknowledge that law enforcers are vulnerable to some opportunities for corruption, but the PNP leadership has continued to strive to block these opportunities for corruption to take place.
